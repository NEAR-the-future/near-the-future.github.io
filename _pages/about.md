**Intelligence does not live in algorithms alone.

It emerges from bodies, brains, and interaction with the world.**

The NEAR Lab studies how intelligent behavior emerges from the tight coupling of neural systems, adaptive learning, and physical embodiment in robotic systems. By integrating bio-inspired morphology, neurorobotics, and lifelong learning, we aim to build robots that learn, adapt, and evolve through real physical interaction.

# What We Do

At NEAR, we develop robotic systems where intelligence is shaped by the body and the environment, not imposed from above. Our research spans theory, hardware, and real-world experiments, with a particular focus on embodied intelligence in dynamic, underactuated systems. We believe that understanding how animals fly, sense, learn, and adapt offers essential principles for the next generation of autonomous robots.

# Research Directions

- Neurorobotics integrating sensing, control, and embodiment
- Brain-inspired computation tightly coupled with physical dynamics

## 🔁 Adaptive & Lifelong Learning
- Learning systems that adapt over long time scales
- Online learning through interaction, not static datasets
- Co-adaptation of morphology, control, and behavior

## ⚙️ Modeling, Dynamics & Control
- Hybrid modeling of bio-inspired robots

# Join Us

We welcome students, postdocs, and collaborators interested in:
- bio-inspired robotics
- neuromorphic systems
- learning robots that fly, adapt, and evolve

Why NEAR?
- Neuro-Embodied: neural principles grounded in real physical systems
- Adaptive: learning and change across time, not fixed behaviors
- Robotics: intelligence tested in the real world, not simulations alone

If you are excited about building robots that learn through their bodies, we would love to hear from you. Together, we are NEAR the future where robots learn like living systems.
