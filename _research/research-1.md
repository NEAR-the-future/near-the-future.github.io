At the **NEAR Lab**, our research centers on **neuro-embodied adaptive robotics** — robotic systems in which intelligence emerges from the interaction between **neural mechanisms, physical bodies, and the environment**.

We pursue an integrated approach spanning **robot design, modeling, control, and learning**, with an emphasis on **real-world embodiment** and **lifelong adaptation**.

## Bio-Inspired & Flapping-Wing Robotics 🦋

We study flying and locomoting systems inspired by insects and animals to uncover fundamental principles of embodied intelligence.

Our work includes:
- design and prototyping of **flapping-wing and morphologically adaptive robots**
- investigation of **aerodynamic–structural–control coupling**
- experimental validation on **highly dynamic, underactuated platforms**

These systems serve both as **engineering artifacts** and as **physical testbeds** for studying embodied intelligence.

## Neuro-Embodied & Neuromorphic Systems 🧠

We explore neural principles of control and learning grounded in physical robotic systems.

Topics include:
- **neurorobotics**, integrating sensing, neural computation, and actuation
- **neuromorphic and neural-inspired architectures** for real-time interaction
- tight coupling between **neural dynamics and body dynamics**

Our goal is to move beyond disembodied computation toward **neural systems shaped by physical interaction**.

## Adaptive & Lifelong Learning 🔁

Rather than learning from static datasets, we focus on robots that **learn continuously through experience**.

We investigate:
- **lifelong and online learning** in physical agents
- co-adaptation of **morphology, control, and behavior**
- learning under changing environments and system dynamics

Learning is treated as a **developmental process**, unfolding over time through interaction.

## Modeling, Dynamics & Control ⚙️

Rigorous modeling and control theory underpin our experimental work.

Our research includes:
- **hybrid and physics-based modeling** of bio-inspired robots
- nonlinear dynamics and **reduced-order representations**
- data-driven and learning-based control for **underactuated systems**

These models enable both **understanding** and **design** of complex robotic behaviors.

---

## Ongoing & Future Directions

Our research continues to expand toward:
- tighter integration of **neuromorphic hardware and robotic platforms**
- **co-design** of body, controller, and learning mechanisms
- experimental studies of **development, adaptation, and evolution** in robots
