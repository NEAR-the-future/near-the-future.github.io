At the **NEAR Lab**, our research centers on **neuro-embodied adaptive robotics**—robotic systems in which intelligence emerges from the interaction between **neural mechanisms, physical bodies, and the environment**.

We pursue an integrated approach spanning **robot design, modeling, control, and learning**, with an emphasis on **real-world embodiment** and **lifelong adaptation**.
